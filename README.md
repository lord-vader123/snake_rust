# Snake in rust
Shitty game that barely works. It's written in rust.

## Compilation
Run: `cargo run`

## OS
It was written and tested on linux, but should probably work on windows too. Never tested that tho.

## Controls
- You use `wsad` to move around.
- You can hold `wsad` to move faster (have no idea why, tho)
- You use q to quit it
- You can't use <C-c> to kill it, cause I'm to lazy to implement that

### If it's so shitty, why did you made that?
- Because I wanted to learn rust. I'm going to make another shitty project now. Probably tic-tac-toe.
